# Ninja Carnage - A 8/16 bits games
Ninja Carnage was created in 2019 for a small Facebook challenge. I decided to create a game in C, on 8 bits AMSTRAD CPC. 
One year later I ported the game on COMMODORE 64, still in C. In the same time Clive Townsend ported the game in assembly on SPECTRUM ZX 128KB.
in 2021 I ported the game in assembly on AMIGA.
An ATARI ST port is on the way (not by me).
